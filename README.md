# Mini-Project
 Hospital Data Analysis in Python — Real-Time Project

In this real-world healthcare analytics project, we use Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze hospital treatment data and extract actionable business insights.

We group patient records by treatment type, calculate patient volume and total treatment cost, and present the findings through side-by-side bar charts. These insights help healthcare analysts and hospital administrators identify the most in-demand treatments, compare service costs, and make data-driven decisions for resource allocation and financial planning.

# Key Project Highlights:
1)Real hospital treatment dataset analysis

2) Data cleaning, grouping & aggregation with Pandas

3) Healthcare KPIs: patient admissions, treatment costs, demand analysis

4) Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn

5) Real-time decision-making insights for hospital management

6) End-to-end analytics workflow for healthcare
   
# Total Patient Admission 
we need to calculate the total number of patients admitted during a specified period
Additionally, it is essential to moniter the Month-to-Date(MTD) Patient Admissions.

# Total Treatement Cost
Understanding the total amount billed for patient treatments is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Treatment Cost metric

# Total Discharges
Tracking the total number of patients discharged is essential for assessing hospital throughput and bed availability. We should also analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Discharges.

# Average Length of Stay (ALOS)
Calculating the average number of days patients stay in the hospital will provide insights into care efficiency and bed utilization. We need to compute both the overall and Month-to-Date (MTD) Average Length of Stay.

# Average Bed Occupancy Rate
Evaluating the average occupancy rate across all wards or departments helps us gauge resource utilization. We need to compute the overall and Month-to-Date (MTD) Bed Occupancy Rate.

# CHARTS Requirements
1) Monthly Trends by Admission Data (Line/ Area Chart):To identify seasonality and long-term trends in patient admissions, helping us understand peak demand periods and adjust staffing and resources accordingly.
2) Regional Analysis by Department or Location (Bar Chart):To identify departments or hospital branches with significant patient volume and assess disparities in service demand across different areas of the hospital or locations.
3) Length of Stay (LOS) distribution (Donut Chart):To allow hospital administrators to understand the distribution of patients across various stay durations, helping optimize bed allocation and discharge planning.
4) Age Group Analysis (Bar Chart):To show how patient admissions and treatment costs are distributed across different age categories, aiding in targeted healthcare planning and specialized service allocation.
5) Bed Occupancy by Ward/Department (Tree / Heat Map):For a hierarchical view of how bed occupancy varies across wards or departments, enabling efficient resource allocation and capacity planning.
6) Treatement Type Breakdown (Bar Chart):To provide a visual breakdown of patient volumes and costs based on the type of treatment received, supporting insights into the hospital’s core medical services.
